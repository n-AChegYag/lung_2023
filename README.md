# Developing and validating a model to identify radiation-resistant populations and detect the location of radiation-resistant region in NSCLC patients undergoing radiotherapy

## Introduction

The dataset comprises 217 patients with NSCLC (147 radiation resistant (RR), 70 radiation sensitive (RS)). These patients were treated with radiotherapy at four institutions, and pre-treatment and post-treatment CT images were obtained at 1â€“3 months of follow-up. A two-stage U-Net framework was developed for identifying radiation-resistant populations and detecting radiation-resistant regions within the tumor before radiotherapy. The framework of our proposed method is shown below.

## Results

The proposed method achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.8095 and an accuracy rate of 81.82% in identifying radiation-resistant populations. Furthermore, within the RR patients, the model demonstrated a recall rate of 0.8050 in identifying radiation-resistant regions within the primary tumor. By broadening the margins of our model's predictions by an average of 2 mm, we achieved a favorable overlap with the radiation-resistant region (average recall of 0.8983 for the internal validation set and 0.8567 for the external validation set).
